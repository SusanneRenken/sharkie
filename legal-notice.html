      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

      <h3>Liability for Content</h3>
      <p>
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
        pages in accordance with &sect; 7 para. 1 TMG under general laws.
        However, according to &sect;&sect; 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated as
        a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party
        information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
        activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under
        general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is
        only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement
        becomes known. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will
        remove this content immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>Liability for Links</h3>
      <p>
        Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, on whose
        contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
        for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
        linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked pages
        were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking.
        Illegal content was not identifiable at the time of linking. A permanent
        content control of the linked pages is, however, not reasonable without
        concrete evidence of a violation. If we become aware of any legal
        infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>Copyright</h3>
      <p>
        The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are
        subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing,
        distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of
        copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or
        creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for
        private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not
        created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected.
        In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you
        nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask that you
        notify us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will
        remove such content immediately.
